# Note Taker 
Week 11 Challenge

This week's assignment involved making modifications to the starter code for a note-taking application that utilizes Express.js on the backend to store and retrieve data from a JSON file. The objective was to develop the backend of the application, integrate it with the front-end, and deploy it to Heroku. The assignment required the following functionalities:
    -Create a clickable link on the homepage that leads to the note-taking page.
    -Upon entering a note title and text and clicking the save button, the note should appear on the left side of the page as a list. The title and text fields should then be cleared to allow for a new note to be created.
    -When the user clicks on an existing note from the list, the title and text of that note should be displayed in the main note field. Clicking on the add note icon should clear the main field to allow for a new note to be created.
    -Bonus Task: When the user clicks on the garbage can icon next to an existing note in the note list, the note should be deleted.
